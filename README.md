## How to write CSS in 2022
To write CSS correctly, you need to know it better first, let's get a little more familiar with CSS and take a closer look at some of it's problems.

<br />

- Not Scalable Syntax
- Bad Browser Support
- Unused CSS Classes
- No Test at All

<br />

## Now what, can we fix them?
Yes, CSS may have problems, but all of these are easily solvable

<br />

### ~~Not Scalable Syntax~~
Why not? You can always scale your CSS using methods like [**BEM**](http://getbem.com/) and [**OOCSS**](http://oocss.org/).

<br />

### ~~Bad Browser Support~~
Unfortunately, different browsers still have different understandings of CSS commands, but that's not a problem! Using a tool like [**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/) this problem can also be solved!

<br />

### ~~Unused CSS Classes~~
Increasing or decreasing the project features creates a list of unused styles, but it is not a problem because with [**PurgeCSS**](https://purgecss.com/) these additional styles are specified and removed from the project bundle.

<br />

### ~~No Test at All~~
Well not exactly, you can unit test CSS using a tool called [**Barista**](https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/css-unit-testing/), but it's not as popular as other methods.
